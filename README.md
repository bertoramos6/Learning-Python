# Learning Python
I created this repo to store all the files I create while learning Python on my own, following youtube tutorials. I mainly followed these two tutorials: 

* 1. [Beginner Python][beginnerPython]
* 2. [Intermediate Python][intermediatePython]

which are both from MoureDev, a spanish streamer and youtuber who does programming tutorials.
